    # The context‑path caused the front‑end to request URLs like /api/v1/api/..., which resulted in 404.
    # Removing it (or setting it to "/") makes the API available directly under /api/ as the UI expects.
    # Uncomment the line below to restore a versioned prefix, but then you must also update the front‑end URLs.
